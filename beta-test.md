# Programmer ('kotone1111' on discord)
- good that bvh wasn't used since octree is more direct and makes more sense
- could have used the 'camera method' to do custom replication & sent them as one giant buffer
- custom part cache is cool

# Non-Programmer (Amanda)
- Should fix the flickering (which I did fix)
- Fix the grey blocks appearing (which I also did fix)
- 'cool'
- Hard to understand what an octree is and why theyre useful at first
- The camera moves slower when destroying an object, which feels bad
- Roblox Studio controls are weird at first
