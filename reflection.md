# What advice would I give myself?
- Be proactive! Finish the hard part early.
- Restart to make the program more efficient earlier. There was no point exploring an objectively worse method.

# Was everything in needs to have completed?
- Yes, everything in needs to have was completed.
- The last idea about the irrelevant parts was stretched a bit, but still completed.

# The hardest part?
- Finding an efficient way to make the octrees
- Understanding the methods other people used to create fast octrees (bitwise operations)
- Getting sleep (look at the times I updated the repo)

# Was there any problem I could not solve?
- I havent tried greedy meshing yet, but I imagine it would be pretty hard
- Other problems I tried I was (eventually) able to solve.
